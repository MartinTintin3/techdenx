**Subject options (pick 1):**

* Quick domain check for {{DOMAIN}} (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
* Are your bulk-sender auth records passing?
* Fixing email auth + unsubscribe compliance in 48 hours

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — quick note.

I help legitimate senders get their domain email authentication + bulk-sender basics set up correctly (SPF, DKIM, DMARC + unsubscribe compliance checks). It’s a flat **$199 “48-hour Compliance Sprint”** with pass/fail proof screenshots + a short report.

I took a quick look at {{DOMAIN}} and couldn’t confirm everything is aligned (could be fine—some setups are hard to spot).

**Who handles DNS for {{DOMAIN}}?** If it’s you, I can tell you what’s missing and fix it fast.

If this isn’t relevant, reply “no” and I won’t follow up.

2. **Follow-up email (<= 80 words)**

Subject: Re: {{DOMAIN}} email auth

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — circling back.

If you send newsletters or customer emails, providers are increasingly strict about **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** and unsubscribe handling for bulk mail. I do a **$199, 48-hour** setup/fix and send pass/fail proof + a 1–2 page report. No inbox placement guarantees—just compliance + verification.

Still the right person for DNS/email sending? If not, who should I talk to?

Reply “no” to opt out.

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}} — quick question: who manages DNS/email sending for {{DOMAIN}}?

I run a $199 **48-hour Email Authentication + Bulk-Sender Compliance Setup** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC + unsubscribe compliance checks). You get pass/fail proof screenshots + a short report. No deliverability guarantees—just correct setup + verification.

If not relevant, say “no” and I’ll stop.

4. **A 20-second “if they ask what this is” explanation**

“It’s a fast compliance sprint to make sure your sending domain is properly authenticated and meets basic bulk-sender requirements. I set up or fix SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, check unsubscribe handling for marketing mail, then send you proof screenshots and a short report showing everything passing. Flat $199, done within 48 hours after DNS access. No promises about inbox placement—just correct setup and verification.”

5. **A 6-question qualification checklist you ask by email (not a call)**

Reply with quick answers:

1. What domain(s) do you send from? (e.g., {{DOMAIN}})
2. What platform(s) send your email? (e.g., Mailchimp, Klaviyo, SendGrid, Postmark, SES, HubSpot, etc.)
3. Approx. how many emails do you send per day/week?
4. Is your list **opt-in / customers only**? (Yes/No)
5. Do you send marketing/newsletters, transactional, or both?
6. Can you grant DNS access (preferred) or do you need me to provide records for you to paste? (Which DNS host?)

6. **A closing message that sends Stripe payment link + intake form link**

Awesome — if you want me to handle it, here’s the next step:

1. Pay the flat **$199** here: {{STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK_URL}}
2. Complete this intake form (takes ~3 minutes): {{INTAKE_FORM_URL}}

Once I have the intake + DNS access/records, I’ll start the 48-hour sprint and deliver:

* SPF/DKIM/DMARC passing/alignment checks
* Bulk-sender unsubscribe compliance checklist (as applicable)
* Proof screenshots + a short “what changed” report

If authentication still fails after implementation (on your actual sending platform), you get a refund.
