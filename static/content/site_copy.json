"faq": {
"headline": "FAQ",
"items": [
{
"q": "What exactly do you set up?",
"a": "We set up or fix SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your sending domain(s) and verify pass/fail results. We also check basic bulk-sender compliance requirements related to unsubscribe handling for legitimate marketing mail (as applicable)."
},
{
"q": "Do you guarantee inbox placement?",
"a": "No. We provide authentication + compliance setup and objective verification (pass/fail checks and proof). Inbox placement depends on many factors outside authentication (content, reputation, list quality, recipient behavior, etc.)."
},
{
"q": "What counts as \"48 hours\"?",
"a": "48 hours starts once you provide required access (DNS access or the ability to publish DNS records) and submit your sending details."
},
{
"q": "What access do you need?",
"a": "Best: delegated DNS access to your DNS provider. Next best: you add the records while we guide you over chat or screenshare. Worst: you forward screenshots and we provide record values only (slower and more error-prone). We never ask for email account passwords."
},
{
"q": "Which email platforms do you support?",
"a": "Most major platforms that use standard SPF/DKIM/DMARC workflows. You'll list your sending provider(s) so we can generate correct records and enable DKIM where needed."
},
{
"q": "Will this fix spoofing?",
"a": "Proper authentication and DMARC reduce spoofing risk and make it harder for attackers to impersonate your domain, but no setup can eliminate all abuse. We will document your DMARC policy and recommend a safe starting policy (monitoring by default)."
},
{
"q": "Can you set DMARC to quarantine or reject?",
"a": "Yes, if you request it and understand the tradeoffs. By default we start with monitoring (p=none) to avoid unintended mail disruptions, then you can move to enforcement after monitoring results."
},
{
"q": "Do you handle multiple domains?",
"a": "This sprint covers one primary sending domain. If you have additional sending domains/subdomains, we can usually handle them, but it may require additional scope depending on complexity."
},
{
"q": "What if my DNS host is hard to use?",
"a": "We’ll provide exact record values and help you place them correctly. If your provider supports delegated access, that’s fastest. If not, we can walk you through it step-by-step."
},
{
"q": "Do you work with cold outreach or purchased lists?",
"a": "No. We do not support spam or illicit email practices, including purchased/scraped lists or tactics meant to bypass provider policies. We only work with legitimate senders (opt-in newsletters, customers/users, and lawful communications)."
},
{
"q": "How do I know this isn’t a scam?",
"a": "You pay through Stripe (secure checkout). We never ask for passwords. For DNS changes, you can either (1) add me as a delegated DNS user, or (2) do a screenshare while you paste the records. After setup, you get proof screenshots + a short report showing SPF/DKIM/DMARC passing."
},
{
"q": "Will you ask for passwords?",
"a": "No. Please don’t send passwords. The safest options are delegated DNS access (add user) or screenshare while you add the DNS records. If you prefer, you can paste the DNS records yourself and We'll verify everything is passing."
